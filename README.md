RJcR implements a custom robot in [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) which features a revolute joint as its neck and stereo camera for capturing images. It also comes with a [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) client designed for the [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/rift/) which receives an image stream from the simulated robot and allows teleoperation of simulated robot neck through head tracking on the Rift.
